    <h3>
        Can Vladimir Putin be removed as Russian president over Ukraine war?
    </h3>
    <p id="paraOne" class="primary" >
        Days after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy taunted the US and its European allies, asking them to admit that they "are scared of Russia", US President Joe Biden responded with a call to remove Russia's President Vladimir Putin from office.

The US government, however, promptly walked back. It denied that Biden was planning a regime change in Russia even though his speech was welcome and termed "historic".

Russia came back at the US saying a change of regime "is not for Biden to decide the president of Russia is elected by Russians".

        The US's ally, France, in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato), too, sounded uncomfortable with Biden's speech.
         France's President Emmanuel Macron warned that a verbal escalation could scuttle peace talks attempting to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.
